Okay chat here's the idea *hear me out*. A CLI app that you can use to track your mood each day throughout the year. Using a terminal plotting library (hopefully) it can display statistics through the year so far, and it primarily saves those statistics in a spreadsheet file maybe (tm). It can track the following data:

| Tracking data | range  | Extra notes |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Mood          | 1 - 5  |             |
| Energy        | 1 - 10 |             |
| Cry           | y/n    |             |
